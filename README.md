## Problem Statement

Many women safety applications depend on internet and mobile networks.

In rural areas, highways, basements, remote locations, or during signal failure, these apps become ineffective.

Delays in communication during emergencies increase risk and reduce response time.

LoRaMesh solves this communication gap by enabling network-independent emergency messaging.
