# LoRaMesh – A network independent communication device

## Overview

LoRaMesh is a compact, long-range, offline communication device designed to enhance women safety in low or zero network areas.

It enables real-time messaging and emergency SOS alerts without relying on mobile networks, WiFi, or internet connectivity.

The device connects directly to an Android smartphone via OTG and provides a WhatsApp-like offline chat interface using LoRa technology.

## Problem Statement

Many women safety applications depend on internet and mobile networks.

In rural areas, highways, basements, remote locations, or during signal failure, these apps become ineffective.

Delays in communication during emergencies increase risk and reduce response time.

LoRaMesh solves this communication gap by enabling network-independent emergency messaging.
